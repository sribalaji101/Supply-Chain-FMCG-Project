**Overview**
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis for a supply chain company facing challenges with customer contract renewals. Using Excel and Power BI, I analyzed data from existing customers and products to understand and address the underlying issues. The focus was on evaluating the company's performance in terms of product delivery times and order frequencies.

**Problem Statement**
The company is experiencing a significant issue with customers not renewing their contracts. To identify the root causes and provide actionable insights, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the company's operational data.

**Objectives**
Analyze customer and product data to identify patterns and trends.
Evaluate the performance of the company in delivering products on time.
Assess the frequency and timing of customer orders.
Provide recommendations to improve customer retention and operational efficiency.

**Tools Used**
  Excel: For initial data cleaning, manipulation, and basic analysis.
  Power BI: For advanced data visualization and in-depth analysis.

**Data Analysis Process**
1.Data Collection and Cleaning:
  * Gathered data from various sources within the company.
  * Cleaned and standardized the data for consistency and accuracy.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  * Conducted EDA to uncover initial patterns and insights.
  * Visualized key metrics to understand the current performance.

3.Performance Analysis:
  * Analyzed product delivery times to identify delays and bottlenecks.
  * Evaluated order times to understand customer ordering behaviors.

4.Customer Segmentation:
  * Segmented customers based on their renewal status and purchasing patterns.
  * Identified high-risk customers who are less likely to renew their contracts.

5.Visualization and Reporting:
  * Created interactive dashboards in Power BI to present findings.
  * Generated reports highlighting key insights and recommendations.

**Key Findings**
1.Delivery Time Delays:
  * Identified significant delays in product delivery affecting customer satisfaction.
  * Specific product lines and regions with the highest delay rates were highlighted.

2.Order Frequency Patterns:
  * Discovered that customers with irregular order frequencies were less likely to renew contracts.
  * Seasonal trends and peak ordering periods were mapped out.

3.Customer Retention Insights:
  * Highlighted key factors contributing to customer attrition.
  * Provided data-driven recommendations to improve retention rates.

**Recommendations**
1.Improve Delivery Times:
  * Optimize logistics and supply chain processes to reduce delivery delays.
  * Implement tracking and real-time monitoring systems for better transparency.

2.Enhance Customer Engagement:
  * Develop targeted communication strategies for high-risk customers.
  * Offer incentives for customers with irregular order patterns to encourage consistency.

3.Operational Efficiency:
  * Streamline order processing to handle peak periods more effectively.
  * Regularly review and adjust inventory management practices to meet demand.

**Conclusion**
By leveraging data analysis, this project provides valuable insights into the operational challenges of the supply chain company. The findings and recommendations aim to enhance customer satisfaction, improve retention rates, and optimize overall performance.
